Project Overview
Title: Real-Time 3D Scene Reconstruction for Minimally Invasive Surgeries
Description:
This project focuses on developing a real-time 3D scene reconstruction system tailored for minimally invasive surgeries. The goal is to provide enhanced visualization that assists surgeons during complex procedures, overcoming the limitations of current methods which lack interactivity and real-time capabilities.
Traditional 3D reconstruction methods are typically computationally intensive and require offline post-surgical analysis. These methods also struggle with dynamic camera movements and surgical manipulations common in endoscopic surgeries. To address these limitations, we developed a prototype framework that enables near-real-time reconstruction with surgeon interaction during the procedure.
The system is composed of three main components:
Interactive Front-End Interface:
This interface allows surgeons to interact with the 3D reconstruction during surgery, giving them real-time feedback and the ability to monitor the ongoing process.
Incremental Back-End Model Training:
A machine learning model processes incoming data in an incremental fashion, continuously refining the 3D reconstruction as new frames or data points become available. This reduces the need for extensive pre-surgery training while maintaining model accuracy.
Periodic Monitoring Unit:
A dedicated monitoring unit periodically synchronizes the front-end and back-end, ensuring the surgeon's interactions and feedback are incorporated into the reconstruction process without delay.
The framework supports multimodal image data and integrates real-time endoscopic video feeds for the reconstruction process. The architecture is designed to handle dynamic changes in camera angles and surgical manipulations without sacrificing accuracy.
Challenges Solved:
Real-time interaction with 3D scene reconstruction during surgery.
Handling dynamic endoscopic views caused by camera movements and surgical manipulations.
Managing the computational demands of real-time processing with incremental model updates.
Future Work:
Extend the prototype into a production-ready system optimized for use in actual surgical environments.
Improve the systemâ€™s robustness and real-time performance, particularly in handling large-scale surgeries.
Explore further integration with robotic surgery systems to enhance interactive capabilities.
